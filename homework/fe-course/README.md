# Financial Engineering Course Project

This repository contains the scaffold for my Financial Engineering coursework.  
The project demonstrates setting up a reproducible Python environment, managing configuration and secrets via `.env`, working with Jupyter notebooks, and maintaining version control with Git & GitHub. Future assignments will build upon this base structure to analyze data, run simulations, and implement financial models.
