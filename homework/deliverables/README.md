## Audience & Rationale
- **Audience**: Category managers & merchandisers who need a quick, reliable read on demand signals (#ratings).
- **Format**: A concise **Markdown report** with embedded figuresâ€”easy to review in GitHub, exportable to PDF, and fast to iterate.

## Contents
- `final_report.md`: Executive summary, 3 core visuals + sensitivity figure, assumptions & risks, and decision implications.
- `images/`: All exported figures (PNG).
- `sensitivity_table.csv`: Numeric results used in the sensitivity figure.
- `subgroup_rmse.csv`: Category RMSE for auditability & drill-down.

## How to use
- Read the **Executive Summary** first.
- Skim the three visuals to understand baseline performance and where it varies.
- Review **Sensitivity** to understand the impact of missing data assumptions.
- Use **Decision Implications** to set thresholds for re-training and data quality alerts.
